# Batch Sequence Fix Deployment Guide

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Issue:** Inventory additions were consolidating quantities instead of creating separate rows/batch numbers  
**Status:** ? FIXED - Ready for deployment

## ?? What This Fix Does

**Problem:** When adding inventory to the same location twice, the system was consolidating quantities into a single row instead of creating separate trackable transactions.

**Solution:** 
- ? Each inventory addition creates a **separate row** with **unique batch number**
- ? **No more quantity consolidation** during regular operations
- ? **Full transaction tracking** with individual batch numbers
- ? **Proper audit trail** for every inventory change

## ?? Deployment Options

### Option 1: phpMyAdmin (Recommended for MAMP users)

**File:** `DEPLOY_BATCH_SEQUENCE_FIX.sql`

**Steps:**
1. Open phpMyAdmin in your browser: `http://localhost/phpMyAdmin`
2. Select your database (`mtm_wip_application_test` or `mtm_wip_application`)
3. Click the **SQL** tab
4. Copy and paste the **ENTIRE CONTENTS** of `DEPLOY_BATCH_SEQUENCE_FIX.sql`
5. Click **Go**
6. Watch the verification results to confirm success

**Advantages:**
- ? Works with any MAMP setup
- ? No command line knowledge needed
- ? Visual feedback during deployment
- ? All SQL is inline (no external file dependencies)

### Option 2: MySQL Command Line

**File:** `DEPLOY_BATCH_SEQUENCE_FIX_CMDLINE.sql`

**Steps:**
1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt
2. Navigate to the `Database/UpdatedDatabase/` directory
3. Run: `mysql -h localhost -u root -p mtm_wip_application_test < DEPLOY_BATCH_SEQUENCE_FIX_CMDLINE.sql`
4. Enter your MySQL password when prompted

**Advantages:**  
- ? Uses SOURCE commands (cleaner)
- ? Faster execution
- ? Good for automated deployments

## ?? Verification Steps

After deployment, you should see these results:

### ? Expected Success Messages:
```
? SUCCESS - Batch Generation Test
? inv_inventory_batch_seq Table Status: 1 record
? Stored Procedures Status: 2 procedures created
? Existing Batch Numbers Analysis: Shows current inventory state
```

### ?? What to Check:
1. **Table Creation:** `inv_inventory_batch_seq` should exist with 1 record
2. **Procedures Created:** Both `inv_inventory_Add_Item` and `inv_inventory_GetNextBatchNumber` should exist
3. **Batch Generation:** Test should return Status_Code = 0 (success)

## ?? Testing the Fix

### Test Case 1: Same Item, Same Location (Critical Test)
1. **Add inventory:** Part "TEST-001", Operation "10", Location "R-A1-01", Quantity 50
2. **Add inventory again:** Same part "TEST-001", Operation "10", Location "R-A1-01", Quantity 25
3. **Expected Result:** 
   - ? Two separate rows in `inv_inventory` table
   - ? First row: Batch 0000000XXX, Quantity 50
   - ? Second row: Batch 0000000XXY, Quantity 25  
   - ? No consolidation occurred

### Test Case 2: Sequential Batch Numbers
1. Add several inventory items
2. **Expected Result:** Batch numbers should be sequential (0000000001, 0000000002, 0000000003, etc.)

### Test Case 3: Application Integration
1. Use the Inventory Tab in your application
2. Add inventory normally through the UI
3. **Expected Result:** Each addition should create separate database rows

## ?? Troubleshooting

### Error: "Field 'current_match' doesn't have a default value"
- **Cause:** Old version of the script or table structure
- **Solution:** Run the deployment script again - it drops and recreates the table

### Error: "Procedure doesn't exist"
- **Cause:** Procedures weren't created properly  
- **Solution:** Check that you ran the ENTIRE script, not just part of it

### Error: "SOURCE command not recognized" 
- **Cause:** Using command line script in phpMyAdmin
- **Solution:** Use `DEPLOY_BATCH_SEQUENCE_FIX.sql` (phpMyAdmin version) instead

### Inventory Still Consolidating
- **Cause:** Application code changes not deployed
- **Solution:** Make sure `Data/Dao_Inventory.cs` has the fixes (no more `FixBatchNumbersAsync()` calls)

## ?? Files in This Fix

| File | Purpose | Usage |
|------|---------|--------|
| `DEPLOY_BATCH_SEQUENCE_FIX.sql` | phpMyAdmin deployment | Copy/paste into phpMyAdmin |
| `DEPLOY_BATCH_SEQUENCE_FIX_CMDLINE.sql` | Command line deployment | Run with mysql command |
| `BATCH_SEQUENCE_TABLE_FIX.sql` | Table creation only | Standalone table fix |
| `../UpdatedStoredProcedures/04_Inventory_Procedures.sql` | Updated procedures | All inventory procedures |

## ? Success Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] **Batch sequence table exists** - Check phpMyAdmin for `inv_inventory_batch_seq`
- [ ] **Procedures created** - Check phpMyAdmin > Routines for inventory procedures  
- [ ] **Test passes** - Deployment script shows ? SUCCESS messages
- [ ] **Application works** - Inventory tab still functions normally
- [ ] **Separate rows created** - New inventory additions don't consolidate
- [ ] **Sequential batch numbers** - Each addition gets next batch number

## ?? After Successful Deployment

**Your MTM Inventory Application will now:**
- ? Create **separate trackable transactions** for each inventory addition
- ? Generate **unique batch numbers** for proper audit trails  
- ? **Never consolidate quantities** during regular operations
- ? Maintain **full transaction history** for compliance and tracking
- ? Support **proper FIFO/LIFO** inventory management

**The consolidation issue that was combining separate transactions into single rows is now completely resolved!**
