## Integration and Usage
**Database Layer Integration:**
- Called by service layer classes to perform data operations
- Uses HelperDatabaseCore for database connectivity
- Integrates with Model classes for data transfer
- Handles database exceptions through error logging utilities

**Example Usage Pattern:**
// var result = await Dao_Notification.GetDataAsync();
// await Dao_Notification.UpdateDataAsync(model);

## Error Handling Strategy
**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Error handling implementation follows application-wide patterns
- Integrates with central error management system
- Provides appropriate error responses to calling code

**Error Recovery:**
- Implements appropriate fallback mechanisms
- Maintains application stability during error conditions
- Provides meaningful error messages for troubleshooting

## Implementation Details and Design Patterns
**Implementation Patterns:**
- Follows object-oriented design principles
- Implements appropriate architectural patterns for the domain
- Maintains code organization and separation of concerns

**Extensibility Points:**
- Designed for future enhancements and modifications
- Supports inheritance and composition for extending functionality
- Maintains backward compatibility where possible

## Thread Safety and Concurrency
**Database Operations:**
- Database connections are typically thread-safe with proper pooling
- Transaction isolation levels provide data consistency
- Connection pooling manages concurrent database access

**Recommendations:**
- Avoid shared mutable state where possible
- Use immutable objects for data transfer
- Implement proper synchronization for shared resources
- Consider thread-safe collections for concurrent scenarios

## Performance and Resource Usage
**Database Performance:**
- Connection pooling optimizes database resource usage
- Query optimization affects overall application performance
- Consider batching operations for bulk data processing
- Monitor connection timeout and retry logic

**Resource Usage:**
- Monitor CPU and memory consumption patterns
- Implement resource cleanup and disposal
- Consider performance implications of design decisions
- Profile under expected load conditions

## Security and Permissions
**Security Considerations:**
- Follows application security guidelines and best practices
- Implements input validation and sanitization
- Protects against common security vulnerabilities

**Security Requirements:**
- Requires appropriate application permissions for operation
- Integrates with application security infrastructure
- Maintains data confidentiality and integrity
- Implements defense-in-depth security strategies

## Testing and Mocking Strategies
**Database Testing Strategies:**
- Use in-memory database or test database for unit testing
- Mock database connections for isolated testing
- Test data validation and error handling scenarios
- Verify SQL query generation and parameter binding
- Test transaction rollback and commit scenarios

**Mocking Strategies:**
- Create interface abstractions for testability
- Use dependency injection for mock substitution
- Mock external services and database dependencies
- Implement test doubles for complex dependencies

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- Happy path scenarios with valid inputs
- Error conditions and exception handling
- Boundary value testing and edge cases
- Concurrent access and thread safety scenarios
- Performance testing under expected load

**Example Test Structure:**
// [TestFixture]
// public class Dao_NotificationTests
// {
//     [Test]
//     public void Dao_Notification_ValidInput_ReturnsExpectedResult()
//     {
//         // Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
//     }
// }

## Configuration and Environment Dependencies
**Configuration Requirements:**
- Follows application-wide configuration patterns
- May require specific runtime environment setup
- Depends on application infrastructure and dependencies

**Environment Setup:**
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed
- Verify configuration files are properly set
- Test in target deployment environment
- Monitor configuration changes and updates
