## Integration and Usage

**Asynchronous Integration:**
- Supports non-blocking operations for better UI responsiveness
- Integrates with async/await patterns throughout the application
- Handles concurrent operations safely

**Example Usage Pattern:**
// var instance = new Service_OnStartup();
// instance.ExecuteOperation();

## Error Handling Strategy
**Exception Handling:**
- Implements try-catch blocks for error management
- Provides graceful degradation in error scenarios
- Integrates with application logging system for error tracking
- Records detailed error information for debugging and monitoring
**Async Error Handling:**
- Handles exceptions in asynchronous operations
- Maintains error context across async boundaries

**Error Recovery:**
- Implements appropriate fallback mechanisms
- Maintains application stability during error conditions
- Provides meaningful error messages for troubleshooting

## Implementation Details and Design Patterns
**Static Factory Pattern:**
- Uses static methods for object creation and utility functions
- Provides shared functionality without instantiation
**Asynchronous Pattern:**
- Implements async/await for non-blocking operations
- Supports scalable and responsive application behavior
**Composition Pattern:**
- Combines multiple classes for complex functionality
- Promotes code reuse and modularity

**Extensibility Points:**
- Designed for future enhancements and modifications
- Supports inheritance and composition for extending functionality
- Maintains backward compatibility where possible

## Thread Safety and Concurrency
**Static Member Considerations:**
- Static members require careful consideration for thread safety
- Shared state may need synchronization mechanisms
**Async Operations:**
- Async methods are generally thread-safe for individual operations
- Avoid shared mutable state across async boundaries
- Use appropriate synchronization for concurrent access

**Recommendations:**
- Avoid shared mutable state where possible
- Use immutable objects for data transfer
- Implement proper synchronization for shared resources
- Consider thread-safe collections for concurrent scenarios

## Performance and Resource Usage
**Asynchronous Performance:**
- Async operations improve UI responsiveness
- Reduces thread blocking for I/O operations
- Monitor async operation completion and timeout handling

**Resource Usage:**
- Monitor CPU and memory consumption patterns
- Implement resource cleanup and disposal
- Consider performance implications of design decisions
- Profile under expected load conditions

## Security and Permissions
**User Security:**
- Implements user authentication and authorization
- Validates user permissions before operations
- Protects against unauthorized access attempts
**Audit and Logging:**
- Maintains audit trails for security monitoring
- Logs security-relevant events and access attempts
- Avoids logging sensitive information

**Security Requirements:**
- Requires appropriate application permissions for operation
- Integrates with application security infrastructure
- Maintains data confidentiality and integrity
- Implements defense-in-depth security strategies

## Testing and Mocking Strategies
**General Testing Strategies:**
- Unit test individual methods and functionality
- Integration test with dependent components
- Mock external dependencies for isolated testing

**Mocking Strategies:**
- Create interface abstractions for testability
- Use dependency injection for mock substitution
- Mock external services and database dependencies
- Implement test doubles for complex dependencies

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- Happy path scenarios with valid inputs
- Error conditions and exception handling
- Boundary value testing and edge cases
- Concurrent access and thread safety scenarios
- Performance testing under expected load

**Example Test Structure:**
// [TestFixture]
// public class Service_OnStartupTests
// {
//     [Test]
//     public void Service_OnStartup_ValidInput_ReturnsExpectedResult()
//     {
//         // Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
//     }
// }

## Configuration and Environment Dependencies
**Application Settings:**
- Depends on application configuration files
- Requires proper environment-specific settings
- May need configuration validation on startup
**Environment Dependencies:**
- Behavior may vary based on environment settings
- Requires appropriate environment configuration
- May need different settings for dev/test/production
**User Configuration:**
- Depends on user-specific settings and preferences
- May require user profile and permission configuration
- Supports personalization and customization options

**Environment Setup:**
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed
- Verify configuration files are properly set
- Test in target deployment environment
- Monitor configuration changes and updates

## Code Examples
**Key Code Structures:**
// async Task RunStartupSequenceAsync(parameters)
// static void DeleteDirectoryContents(parameters)
// static void WipeAppDataFolders(parameters)
// static class Service_OnStartup
// static class Service_OnStartup_AppDataCleaner
// Note: All code examples are commented to prevent markdown rendering issues
// Refer to the actual source file for complete implementation details
