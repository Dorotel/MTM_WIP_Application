- Integration test with dependent components
- Mock external dependencies for isolated testing

**Mocking Strategies:**
- Create interface abstractions for testability
- Use dependency injection for mock substitution
- Mock external services and database dependencies
- Implement test doubles for complex dependencies

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- Happy path scenarios with valid inputs
- Error conditions and exception handling
- Boundary value testing and edge cases
- Concurrent access and thread safety scenarios
- Performance testing under expected load

**Example Test Structure:**
// [TestFixture]
// public class JsonColorConverterTests
// {
//     [Test]
//     public void JsonColorConverter_ValidInput_ReturnsExpectedResult()
//     {
//         // Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
//     }
// }

## Configuration and Environment Dependencies
**Configuration Requirements:**
- Follows application-wide configuration patterns
- May require specific runtime environment setup
- Depends on application infrastructure and dependencies

**Environment Setup:**
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed
- Verify configuration files are properly set
- Test in target deployment environment
- Monitor configuration changes and updates

## Code Examples
**Key Code Structures:**
// override void Write(parameters)
// public class JsonColorConverter : JsonConverter<Color?>
// Note: All code examples are commented to prevent markdown rendering issues
