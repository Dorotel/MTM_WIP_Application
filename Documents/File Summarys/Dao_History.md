## Integration and Usage
**Database Layer Integration:**
- Called by service layer classes to perform data operations
- Uses HelperDatabaseCore for database connectivity
- Integrates with Model classes for data transfer
- Handles database exceptions through error logging utilities

**Asynchronous Integration:**
- Supports non-blocking operations for better UI responsiveness
- Integrates with async/await patterns throughout the application
- Handles concurrent operations safely

**Example Usage Pattern:**
// var result = await Dao_History.GetDataAsync();
// await Dao_History.UpdateDataAsync(model);

## Error Handling Strategy
**Async Error Handling:**
- Handles exceptions in asynchronous operations
- Maintains error context across async boundaries

**Error Recovery:**
- Implements appropriate fallback mechanisms
- Maintains application stability during error conditions
- Provides meaningful error messages for troubleshooting

## Implementation Details and Design Patterns
**Static Factory Pattern:**
- Uses static methods for object creation and utility functions
- Provides shared functionality without instantiation
**Asynchronous Pattern:**
- Implements async/await for non-blocking operations
- Supports scalable and responsive application behavior

**Extensibility Points:**
- Designed for future enhancements and modifications
- Supports inheritance and composition for extending functionality
- Maintains backward compatibility where possible

## Thread Safety and Concurrency
**Static Member Considerations:**
- Static members require careful consideration for thread safety
- Shared state may need synchronization mechanisms
**Async Operations:**
- Async methods are generally thread-safe for individual operations
- Avoid shared mutable state across async boundaries
- Use appropriate synchronization for concurrent access
**Database Operations:**
- Database connections are typically thread-safe with proper pooling
- Transaction isolation levels provide data consistency
- Connection pooling manages concurrent database access

**Recommendations:**
- Avoid shared mutable state where possible
- Use immutable objects for data transfer
- Implement proper synchronization for shared resources
- Consider thread-safe collections for concurrent scenarios

## Performance and Resource Usage
**Asynchronous Performance:**
- Async operations improve UI responsiveness
- Reduces thread blocking for I/O operations
- Monitor async operation completion and timeout handling
**Database Performance:**
- Connection pooling optimizes database resource usage
- Query optimization affects overall application performance
- Consider batching operations for bulk data processing
- Monitor connection timeout and retry logic

**Resource Usage:**
- Monitor CPU and memory consumption patterns
- Implement resource cleanup and disposal
- Consider performance implications of design decisions
- Profile under expected load conditions

## Security and Permissions
**Database Security:**
- Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implements proper connection string security
- Follows principle of least privilege for database access
- Encrypts sensitive data in transit and at rest
**User Security:**
- Implements user authentication and authorization
- Validates user permissions before operations
- Protects against unauthorized access attempts

**Security Requirements:**
- Requires appropriate application permissions for operation
- Integrates with application security infrastructure
- Maintains data confidentiality and integrity
- Implements defense-in-depth security strategies

## Testing and Mocking Strategies
**Database Testing Strategies:**
- Use in-memory database or test database for unit testing
- Mock database connections for isolated testing
- Test data validation and error handling scenarios
- Verify SQL query generation and parameter binding
- Test transaction rollback and commit scenarios

**Mocking Strategies:**
- Create interface abstractions for testability
- Use dependency injection for mock substitution
- Mock external services and database dependencies
- Implement test doubles for complex dependencies

**Test Coverage Areas:**
- Happy path scenarios with valid inputs
- Error conditions and exception handling
- Boundary value testing and edge cases
- Concurrent access and thread safety scenarios
- Performance testing under expected load

**Example Test Structure:**
// [TestFixture]
// public class Dao_HistoryTests
// {
//     [Test]
//     public void Dao_History_ValidInput_ReturnsExpectedResult()
//     {
//         // Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
//     }
// }

## Configuration and Environment Dependencies
**Database Configuration:**
- Requires database connection string configuration
- Depends on database server availability and connectivity
- May require specific database schema and permissions
**User Configuration:**
- Depends on user-specific settings and preferences
- May require user profile and permission configuration
- Supports personalization and customization options

**Environment Setup:**
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed
- Verify configuration files are properly set
- Test in target deployment environment
- Monitor configuration changes and updates
