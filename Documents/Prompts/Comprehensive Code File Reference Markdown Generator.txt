Create a comprehensive Markdown reference
The summary should be robust enough to answer any possible question about the file, including:
•	File metadata (file name, namespace, main classes, target framework, language version, dependencies)
•	The file’s purpose and all intended use cases
•	Key components (classes, methods, properties, fields, events, delegates, etc.) with clear explanations
•	How the file integrates with or is used by the rest of the application (including example usage if relevant)
•	Error handling strategies and any known limitations or gotchas
•	Notable implementation details, design patterns, or extensibility points
•	Any relevant code snippets (commented out to avoid breaking Markdown rendering)
•	A summary section that explains why this file is important and when to reference it
The output should be a single Markdown code block, with all code samples commented out, and formatted for easy reading and searching.
Assume the reader may not have the file open, so include all context needed for understanding and future reference.

When creating markdown documentation:
- Do NOT use triple backticks (```) within the markdown code block
- Present all code examples as comments using // syntax
- Avoid any markdown formatting that could break the outer code block
- Keep all content as plain text with simple formatting

Create new .md file
Do not allow your answer to be truncated
Do not use the active document
Only reference files that I provide
