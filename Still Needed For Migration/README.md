# Still Needed For Migration - MTM MAUI Application

This folder contains all the remaining information and files needed to complete the MAUI migration for the MTM WIP Application.

## Overview

The MAUI migration project structure has been created at https://github.com/Dorotel/MTM_Inventory_Applicaiton_MAUI with basic foundation. This folder contains the additional business logic, configurations, and implementation details needed to complete the migration.

## Contents

### 1. Business Logic
- Core application logic classes that need MAUI adaptation
- Service implementations requiring dependency injection setup
- Helper classes and utilities for cross-platform use

### 2. Data Models
- Current WinForms data models that need MAUI ViewModels
- Database entity models requiring adaptation
- Transfer objects and DTOs

### 3. Database Integration
- Connection string management for production/debug environments
- Stored procedure integration patterns
- Database access layer implementation

### 4. UI Components
- UserControl implementations that need MAUI ContentView conversion
- Custom controls requiring platform-specific implementations
- Form layouts that need XAML page conversion

### 5. Configuration & Settings
- Application configuration files
- User settings management
- Environment-specific configurations

### 6. Resources & Assets
- Application icons and images
- Fonts and styling resources
- Platform-specific assets

### 7. Error Handling & Logging
- Centralized error handling patterns
- Logging infrastructure
- Exception management strategies

### 8. Testing & Validation
- Current testing patterns
- Validation logic
- Business rule implementations

## Usage Instructions

1. Copy the relevant files to the MAUI project repository
2. Adapt WinForms patterns to MAUI/MVVM architecture
3. Implement dependency injection for services
4. Convert UserControls to ContentViews
5. Adapt Forms to Pages/Views with ViewModels
6. Configure platform-specific implementations

## Migration Priorities

1. **Core Services** - Database access and business logic
2. **Data Models** - Entity and ViewModel conversions
3. **Main UI** - Primary application views
4. **Configuration** - Settings and environment management
5. **Error Handling** - Cross-platform error management
6. **Resources** - Platform assets and theming

## Database Compatibility

All database operations maintain 100% compatibility with existing MySQL infrastructure:
- 282+ stored procedures preserved
- Connection string management with server detection
- Production/debug environment switching
